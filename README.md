# Truss-Structure-Analysis-Project
 This project focuses on analyzing forces on truss members by reading data from input files containing lengths and forces on truss elements such as FA, FB, LA, and LB. It reads case numbers based on a condition linked to the student ID, calculates the maximum forces, and outputs them in a formatted manner.
